PAST is everything you love about JOSE (JWT, JWE, JWS) without any of the
[many design deficits that plague the JOSE standards](https://paragonie.com/blog/2017/03/jwt-json-web-tokens-is-bad-standard-that-everyone-should-avoid).

What follows is a reference implementation. **Requires PHP 7 or newer.**

# What is PAST?

PAST (Platform-Agnostic Security Tokens) is a specification and reference implementation
for secure stateless tokens.

Unlike JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which gives developers more than enough rope with which to
hang themselves, PAST only allows secure operations. JWT gives you "algorithm agility",
PAST gives you "versioned protocols". It's incredibly unlikely that you'll be able to
use PAST in [an insecure way](https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries). 

## Key Differences between PAST and JWT

### PAST

```
v2.auth.eyJkYXRhIjoidGhpcyBpcyBhIHNpZ25lZCBtZXNzYWdlIiwiZXhwIjoiMjAzOS0wMS0wMVQwMDowMDowMCJ9.VpWy4KU60YnKUzTkixFi9foXhXKTHbcDBtpg7oWllm8=
```

This decodes to:

* Version: `v2`
* Purpose: `auth` (shared-key authentication)
* Payload:
  ```json
  {
    "data": "this is a signed message",
    "exp": "2039-01-01T00:00:00"
  }
  ```
* Authentication tag:
  ```
  VpWy4KU60YnKUzTkixFi9foXhXKTHbcDBtpg7oWllm8=
  ```

To learn what each version means, please see [this page in the documentation](https://github.com/paragonie/past/tree/master/docs/01-Protocol-Versions).

### JWT

An example JWT ([taken from JWT.io](https://jwt.io)) might look like this:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ 
```

This decodes to:

**Header**:
```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

**Body**:
```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
```

**Signature**:  
```
TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ
```

## Motivation 

As you can see, with JWT, you get to specify an `alg` header. There are a lot of options to
choose from (including `none`).

There have been ways to exploit JWT libraries by replacing RS256 with HS256 and using
the known public key as the HMAC-SHA256 key, thereby allowing arbitrary token forgery. 

With PAST, your options are `version` and a `purpose`. There are three possible
values for `purpose`:

* `auth` -- shared-key authentication
* `enc`  -- shared-key encryption
* `sign` -- public-key authentication (a.k.a. digital signatures)

All encryption modes use [authenticated modes](https://tonyarcieri.com/all-the-crypto-code-youve-ever-written-is-probably-broken).

Regardless of the purpose selected, the header (and an optional footer, which is always
cleartext but base64url-encoded) is included in the signature or authentication tag.
